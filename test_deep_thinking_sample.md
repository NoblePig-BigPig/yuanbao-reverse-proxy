## Deep Thinking Analysis

### Phase 1: Question Clarification (澄清问题)

**Understanding the Core Problem:**

The question asks about reducing carbon emissions specifically in urban transportation. Let me clarify:

1. **Scope Definition**: Urban transportation includes private vehicles (cars, motorcycles), public transit (buses, trains, subways), freight/logistics within city limits, micromobility (bikes, scooters), and walking infrastructure.

2. **Emission Sources**: 
   - Direct tailpipe emissions from fossil fuel vehicles
   - Indirect emissions from electricity generation (for electric vehicles and public transit)
   - Manufacturing and maintenance of transportation infrastructure
   - Induced demand from transportation network changes

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - >30% reduction in CO2 from transportation sector
   - Measurable air quality improvement (PM2.5, NOx levels)
   - Public satisfaction increase (survey-based)

4. **Implicit Constraints Discovered**:
   - Political feasibility suggests stakeholder buy-in (citizens, businesses, transit unions)
   - Limited budget implies prioritizing high-impact, low-cost interventions
   - 5-year timeline requires solutions with quick wins AND long-term structural changes

### Phase 2: Problem Decomposition (问题分解)
