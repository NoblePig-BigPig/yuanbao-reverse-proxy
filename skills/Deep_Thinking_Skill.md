## Implementation Protocol

### Phase 1: Question Clarification (澄清问题)

**Objective**: Ensure complete understanding of the user's intent

**Process**:
1. Identify explicit requirements
2. Uncover implicit assumptions
3. Define scope boundaries
4. Establish success criteria

**Key to Ask**:
- What is the core problem?
- What are the constraints?
- What does a "perfect" answer look like?
- What context is missing?

### Phase 2: Problem Decomposition (问题分解)

**Objective**: Break complex problems into manageable components

**Techniques**:
- MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- First Principles Thinking
- Systems Thinking
- Root Cause Analysis

**Decomposition Framework**:
```
MAIN PROBLEM
    ├── Sub-problem A
    │   ├── Aspect A1
    │   ├── Aspect A2
    │   └── Aspect A3
    ├── Sub-problem B
    │   ├── Aspect B1
    │   └── Aspect B2
    └── Sub-problem C
        └── Aspect C1
```

### Phase 3: Multi-Angle Analysis (多角度分析)

**Objective**: Examine the problem from different perspectives

**Standard Perspectives**:
1. **Logical Perspective** (逻辑视角): Facts, evidence, causality
2. **Practical Perspective** (实践视角): Feasibility, resources, timing
3. **Strategic Perspective** (战略视角): Long-term implications, big picture
4. **Creative Perspective** (创新视角): Novel approaches, alternatives
5. **Risk Perspective** (风险视角): Potential failures, mitigations
6. **Stakeholder Perspective** (利益相关者视角): Who is affected and how

### Phase 4: Perspective Shifting (视角转换)

**Objective**: Challenge assumptions and explore alternative viewpoints

**Methods**:
- Devil's Advocate
- First Principles (Elon Musk approach)
- Analogy Mapping
- Reverse Engineering
- Historical Precedent Analysis

### Phase 5: Synthesis (综合整合)

**Objective**: Combine insights into coherent understanding

**Synthesis Matrix**:
| Aspect  | Finding 1 | Finding 2 | Finding 3                         | Synthesized Answer |
| ------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Quality | High      | Medium    | High                              | Overall High       |
| Risk    | Low       | High      | Medium Manageable with mitigation |
| Impact  | Major     | Minor     | Major                             | Significant        |
| ...     | ...       | ...       | ...                               | ...                |

### Phase 6: Critique & Refinement (批判与完善)

**Objective**: Identify weaknesses and improve the answer

**Critique Checklist**:
- [ ] Is the logic sound?
- [ ] Are all angles covered?
- [ ] Is anything missing?
- [ ] Are there contradictions?
- [ ] Is the conclusion justified?
- [ ] Is the answer actionable?
- [ ] Is the answer complete?
- [ ] Is the answer clear?

### Phase 7: Iteration (迭代优化)

**Objective**: Continue until the answer reaches perfection threshold

**Iteration Triggers**:
- New information discovered
- Logical gaps identified
- Better approach found
- User feedback received
- Confidence level < 95%

**Perfection Criteria**:
- Comprehensiveness: All aspects covered
- Accuracy: Facts verified
- Clarity: Easy to understand
- Actionability: Practical guidance provided
- Depth: Sufficient detail
- Balance: Multiple perspectives considered

## Integration with Task Loop Operation

This skill enhances the standard Task Loop Operation by adding depth to each phase:

| Phase                | Enhancement                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Requirement Analysis | Multi-angle questioning, challenging            |
| Step Planning        | Systems thinking decomposition, risk assessment |
| Execution            | Continuous critique during implementation       |
| Verification         | Comprehensive acceptance criteria checking      |
| Failure Handling     | Root cause analysis for recurring issues        |

## Best Practices

1. **Never rush to answer** - Take time to think deeply
2. **Embrace uncertainty** - Acknowledge what you don't know
3. **Seek disconfirmation** - Actively look for evidence against your ideas
4. **Think in systems** - Consider interconnections and second-order effects
5. **Document reasoning** - Show your thought process
6. **Be willing to change** - Update conclusions when better information emerges
7. **Sleep on it** - Sometimes the best thinking happens after a break

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- [ ] Jumping to conclusions prematurely
- [ ] Confirmation bias (only seeking supporting evidence)
- [ ] Ignoring contradictory information
- [ ] Over-complicating simple problems
- [ ] Under-thinking complex problems
- [ ] Failing to question assumptions
- [ ] Not considering edge cases
- [ ] Relying on intuition alone

## Example Application

**Problem**: "How should we improve our software development process?"

**Deep Thinking Application**:

1. **Clarify**: What does "improve" mean? Speed? Quality? Developer happiness?
2. **Decompose**: Break into planning, coding, testing, deployment, maintenance
3. **Multi-Angle**: Look at it from developer, manager, customer, business perspectives
4. **Perspective Shift**: What would a startup do differently? What would Google do?
5. **Synthesize**: Combine findings into cohesive recommendations
6. **Critique**: Are these recommendations realistic? Cost-effective? Scalable?
7. **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback and deeper analysis

**Result**: A comprehensive, nuanced answer that considers all factors and provides actionable, well-reasoned recommendations.
